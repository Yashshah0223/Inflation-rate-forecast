# A few insights that would help others for inflation rate forecasting : 

As many wise men say," Always learn from your mistakes " and so we have a few things to add for those who would like to forecast inflation rate for any country. 
- For inflation rate one should never use a Yearly dataset if they are not taking into account the variables which play a significant role for formualtion inflation.
If one uses a yearly dataset with no other variables than inflation rate, they will not be able to catch seasonality of the time series using decomp or stl. 
Try to use monthly inflation dataset or weekly based on your preference .
Identify the reasons or variables leading to changes in inflation rate and USE them in your dataset. Generally select a dataset composed of inflation rate, CPI (Given by BLS), Bank rates.
The Federal Reserve uses in particular PCE price index, one can take it as a variable but then disregard CPI. 
Secondly when forecasting an Inflation rate always divide your dataset ideally 80-20 into train-test set and use the best fit model to forecast. For this one needs VARIABLES. 
It is not ideal to use past inflation rate to forecast following year's inflation rate. 
As any good business analyst or forecaster will say, spend more time on your data and understand how it works to provide better decision making insights.
