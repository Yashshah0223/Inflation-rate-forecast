# Inflation-rate-forecast
This project is for forecasting the inflation rate of United States of America using the past values that we have gathered by using R.
What I'm currently working on - Business Forecasting 
- Currently i am working on forecasting inflation rate of USA by determining the past trends and using the past values to forecast the following year's inflation rate. Inflation rate affects various part of our daily lives, it affects everyone from a small business owner to a huge conglomerate. By forecasting the inflation rate, economists and policy makers whose job is to aid take decisions as to promote stable prices need accurate forecasts in order to monitor inflation and make necessary corrections when needed.
- A Bit about the Dataset and the output of the project we are looking for :
- The dataset has two columns, namely year's and inflation rate for the country for that year. 
- The dataset is in yearly manner. The data spans from 1960 to 2020, a total of 61 years.    
- This forecast's outcome will be a point specific outcome as we need inflation rate which is given in point form and not range. 
- To measure how accurate our forecast model are we will use RMSE for this topic, RMSE if 0 states that the forecasting performance is perfect and anything higher says the difference between forecasted value and realised value.
- The data that we will be using to forecast is referred from the data collected and curated by The World Bank organization. One can easily find the data at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG NOTE - We will be using only United States of America as the country.
